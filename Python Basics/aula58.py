The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better tha crowded.
Sparse is better than dense.
Legibility counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break rules.
Although practicality wins over purity.
Mistakes should never pass silently.
Unless they are explicitly silenced.
When faced with ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Must have a -- and just one -- obvious mode to do something.
Although this mode may not be obvious at first glance unless you are Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than "exactly" now.
If the implementation is difficult to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, might be a good idea.
Namespaces are a great idea -- let's make more of them!
